# Lab 4.3: Prime Numbers (TDD Style)
## Task
Using Test Driven Development practices, create an application that locates prime numbers.

## What will the application do?
* The application locates prime numbers in a sequence (ex: 1st prime number is 2, 10th prime number is 29, etc.; note that 1 isn’t considered a prime).
* The application prompts the user which sequenced prime they want to locate.
* The application displays the prime number and its sequence number, and prompts the user to find another prime.
* When the user chooses to end his or her search, the application displays a goodbye message.

## Build Specifications/Grading Standards
Follow the Test-Driven Development process to create your solution.
1. Create a Prime Numbers class with a GetPrime() method. GetPrime returns the nth prime number where n is the method’s integer parameter. (1 returns 2, 2 returns 3, 3 returns 5, etc.
    1. Class is properly formed—1 point
    1. Method has proper header—1 point
    1. Method returns the correct prime number for the argument—2 points
1. Create Unit Tests for your program, as you go, following TDD methodology. Write a test, fail it, implement code, pass it, repeat.
    1. Solution has at least 5 valid Unit Tests—5 points (1 each)
1. Create a Main which takes user input and, using the class, displays the proper prime
    1. Program takes integer input correctly and displays the prime—1 point


## Extended Challenges
* Consider efficiency. What algorithm would have the greatest time efficiency? Now that you’ve got tests, refactor your code for efficiency.
